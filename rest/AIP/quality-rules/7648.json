    "rationale": "Object.finalize() method are supposed to be invoked at most one time by the garbage collector on Objects which are no longer referenced. This method can be invoked by another thread in parallel. Explicit invocation of a finalizer ignores the current state of the object and does not change the state of the object from unfinalized or finalizable to finalized.",

Finalize() method is used only to release memory resources.\n- if it is used for memory resources, the Garbage collector will handle the invocation, so just remove the explicit call.",
